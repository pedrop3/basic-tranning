/**
 * ### Exercise: Even Number Counter with Multi-threading
 * **Description:**
 *
 * You need to implement a Java program that counts the number of even numbers in a large array of integers, using multi-threading to improve performance.
 *
 * **Requirements:**
 *
 * - **Input:** An array of integers (for example, `int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};`).
 * - **Output:** The total number of even numbers in the array.
 *
 * **Conditions:**
 * - Use at least two threads to divide the task of counting the even numbers.
 * - The threads should sum up their partial results, and the total sum must be displayed at the end.

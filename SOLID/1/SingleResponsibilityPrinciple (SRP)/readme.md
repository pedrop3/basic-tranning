A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

This means that a class must have only one responsibility.

When a class focuses on a single task, it contains a limited number of methods and member variables, making it more usable and easier to maintain.

If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to understand, maintain, and modify, increasing the potential for bugs, as changes to one responsibility could affect the others.
